Shahrzad is a Senior Applied Research Scientist in AI for Good Research Lab at Microsoft. Her passion lies in harnessing the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to tackle global societal and environmental challenges. With a strong focus on AI for Good, Shahrzad’s research spans a wide spectrum, including environmental sustainability, humanitarian endeavors, and healthcare innovations. Before her tenure at Microsoft, Shahrzad earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California. Her doctoral work yielded promising results, culminating in the creation of PAWS (Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security) – an end-to-end AI solution that employs artificial intelligence techniques to forecast poachers’ behavior. This facilitates strategic patrols for the safeguarding of endangered wildlife worldwide. This effort garnered coverage from prominent media outlets like Forbes and BBC. Shahrzad’s expertise extends to diverse domains, including healthcare where she has made impactful contributions by employing advanced deep learning computer vision techniques for medical imaging data analysis, leading to enhanced disease detection. Additionally, her endeavors encompass predictive models for critical scenarios like wildfire and food security, integrating survey, climate, and geospatial data to drive insightful forecasts. Notably, Shahrzad has also leveraged remotely sensed imagery data and deep learning computer vision techniques to develop disaster response models, aiding in rapid building damage assessment during crises. Shahrzad has an unwavering commitment to leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques and technology for the betterment of society.

		  <summary>TLDR: Develop damage assessment models based on remote sensing data.</summary> 
		  Natural disasters frequency is growing globally. Every year 350 million people are affected and billions of dollars of damage is incurred. Providing timely and appropriate humanitarian interventions like shelters, medical aid, and food to affected communities are challenging problems. AI frameworks can help support existing efforts in solving these problems in various ways. In this study, we propose using high-resolution satellite imagery from before and after disasters to develop a convolutional neural network model for localizing buildings and scoring their damage level. We categorize damage to buildings into four levels, spanning from not damaged to destroyed, based on the xView2 dataset's scale. Due to the emergency nature of disaster response efforts, the value of automating damage assessment lies primarily in the inference speed, rather than accuracy. We show that our proposed solution works three times faster than the fastest xView2 challenge winning solution and over 50 times faster than the slowest first place solution, which indicates a significant improvement from an operational viewpoint. Our proposed model achieves a pixel-wise Fl score of 0.74 for the building localization and a pixel-wise harmonic Fl score of 0.6 for damage classification and uses a simpler architecture compared to other studies. Additionally, we develop a web-based visualizer that can display the before and after imagery along with the model's building damage predictions on a custom map. This study has been collaboratively conducted to empower a humanitarian organization as the stakeholder, that plans to deploy and assess the model along with the visualizer for their disaster response efforts in the field.
